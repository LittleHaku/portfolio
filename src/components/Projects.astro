To do this a root note and a depth is selected, then the wikilinks are explored in a BFS (Breadth-First Search) way until the depth, this allow to for example join all of our Deep Learning notes so we can study before an exam, or to pass them to an LLM so that it helps us by telling us what is incorrect, or finding gaps in our knowledge.",
