# My own portfolio

Here I will show some of my projects. Maybe in the future I add a blog section.

If you want to run this project locally, you can do it by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LittleHaku/portfolio.git
```

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the project

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4321/`

If you want to build the project, you can do it by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

And the project will be built in the `dist` folder.
